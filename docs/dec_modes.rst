DEC Private Modes
=================

DEC Private Modes are terminal control sequences that enable or disable specific
terminal behaviors.

The blessed library provides an API for:

- *Query* using the :meth:`~blessed.Terminal.get_dec_mode` ("DECRQM") method.
- *Enable* using the :meth:`~blessed.Terminal.dec_modes_enabled` ("DECSET")
  context manager.
- *Disable* using the :meth:`~blessed.Terminal.dec_modes_disabled` ("DECRST")
  context manager.

Each mode is identified by a numeric value, and can be identified by constants
attached to class attribute :attr:`Terminal.DecPrivateMode <blessed.Terminal.DecPrivateMode>`.
Our list of modes was derived from https://wiki.tau.garden/dec-modes/

A simple example:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 7,11,13,17,22

   from blessed import Terminal

   term = Terminal()

   # Temporarily disable cursor
   with term.dec_modes_disabled(term.DecPrivateMode.DECTCEM):
        # Cursor is hidden
        print("Working...")
        time.sleep(2)


Using get_dec_mode (DECRQM)
---------------------------

DEC Private Modes control various terminal features like cursor visibility,
mouse tracking, alternate screen buffers, and modern features like synchronized
output. For example we can test support for mode 1000, "Basic mouse click
reporting", :attr:`~blessed.dec_mode.DecPrivateMode.MOUSE_REPORT_CLICK` like so:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 7,11,13,17,22

   from blessed import Terminal

   term = Terminal()

   # make query
   response = term.get_dec_mode(term.DecPrivateMode.MOUSE_REPORT_CLICK, timeout=1.0)

   # display response
   print("Status of basic mouse click reporting: ", end='')
   if response.is_supported():
       print('supported, currently ',end='')
       if response.is_enabled():
           print("enabled ", end='')
       else:
           print("disabled ", end='')
       if response.is_permanent():
           print('permanently (cannot be changed)')
       else:
           print('temporarily (can be changed)')

   elif response.is_failed():
       print("this terminal is not DEC Private Mode capable!")
   else:
       print("Not supported.")

This may produce output::

    Status of MOUSE_REPORT_CLICK(1000) is RESET(2): supported, currently disabled temporarily (can be changed)

The :class:`~blessed.dec_modes.DecModeResponse` object provides several helper methods:

- :meth:`~blessed.dec_modes.DecModeResponse.is_supported`: Mode is recognized by terminal
- :meth:`~blessed.dec_modes.DecModeResponse.is_enabled`: Mode is currently active
- :meth:`~blessed.dec_modes.DecModeResponse.is_disabled`: Mode is currently inactive
- :meth:`~blessed.dec_modes.DecModeResponse.is_permanent`: Mode setting cannot be changed
- :meth:`~blessed.dec_modes.DecModeResponse.is_failed`: Query failed or timed out

"With" modes (DECSET, DECRST)
-----------------------------

The recommended way to temporarily enable or disable modes is through the
context managers :meth:`~blessed.Terminal.dec_modes_enabled` ("DECSET") and
:meth:`~blessed.Terminal.dec_modes_disabled` ("DECRST").

An unsupported mode may be requested, but you may wish to independently check
for its activation by the :meth:`~blessed.Terminal.get_dec_mode` ("DECRQM")
method.

Because a terminal may not respond (ever!), it is suggested to set an
appropriate timeout.

Timeouts and Caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DEC Private Mode queries involve terminal communication and *may* timeout:

.. code-block:: python

    from blessed import Terminal

    term = Terminal()
    mode = term.DecPrivateMode.DECTCEM
    resp = term.get_dec_mode(mode, timeout=1.0)

    if resp.is_failed():
        print("Query failed for mode", repr(mode))

    if resp.is_supported():
        print(mode, "is supported by your terminal!")

Query results are cached automatically. Use ``force=True`` to bypass the cache:

.. code-block:: python

    # Force a fresh query
    response = term.get_dec_mode(term.DecPrivateMode.DECTCEM, force=True)

Because queries are cached, it is possible to repeatedly change modes using the
context managers, and the timeout cost is only incurred on the first call, as
done in the next example.

Synchronized Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Synchronized Output is implemented by the terminal emulator, it allow us to
"paint" onto a hidden screen while entering this context, and to have the new
canvas displayed immediately in single redraw, without any cursor movement or
intermediary drawing effects.

Some people prefer to "clear" previous screen before drawing the next, but this
causes a kind of "blinking" effect. Synchronized Output can be used to remove
the blink effect on supporting terminals.

In this example, we fill screen with full "block" and empty cells in rapid
sequence.  On a terminal that does not support SYNCHRONIZED_OUTPUT, this will
cause a rapid blinking effect, where terminals that do support this mode will
simply display a full "block" screen without any blinking.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 7,11,13,17,22

    from blessed import Terminal

    term = Terminal()

    # WARNING! This may rapidly blink the screen !
    fillblocks = "â–ˆ" * term.height * term.width
    emptyblocks = " " * term.height * term.width
    for step in range(500):
        with term.dec_modes_enabled(term.DecPrivateMode.SYNCHRONIZED_OUTPUT, timeout=1):
            print(term.home + emptyblocks, flush=True)
            print(term.home + fillblocks, flush=True)
            print(term.home + f'step={step}')
        term.inkey(0.01)

If your terminal supports this mode, it will quickly be negotiated about and
re-enabled the first and every call to
:meth:`~blessed.Terminal.dec_modes_enabled`. A timeout parameter of ``1`` is
used, this may cause a 1 second delay on first loop and the terminal is then
considered incapable and no further negotiation is done.


Receiving DEC Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When some kinds of DEC Private Modes are enabled, the terminal sends special
event sequences that can be received through :meth:`~blessed.Terminal.inkey`.

These events have an :attr:`~.Keystroke.event_mode` property and
provide structured data through :meth:`~.Keystroke.mode_values`.


Bracketed Paste Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When :attr:`~blessed.dec_mode.DecPrivateMode.BRACKETED_PASTE` (mode 2004) is
enabled, the data pasted by a user's clipboard can be received as a single
:class:`~.Keystroke` object from the :meth:`~Terminal.inkey` method.

When :attr:`Keystroke.mode` is equal to
:attr:`~blessed.dec_mode.DecPrivateMode.BRACKETED_PASTE`, a
:class:`blessed.keyboard.BracketedPasteEvent` instance is returned by method
:meth:`~.Keystroke.mode_values` containing the ``text`` attribute of pasted
text.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from blessed import Terminal

    term = Terminal()

    with term.dec_modes_enabled(term.DecPrivateMode.BRACKETED_PASTE):
        print("Paste some text...")
        ks = term.inkey()

        if ks.event_mode == term.DecPrivateMode.BRACKETED_PASTE:
            event = ks.mode_values()
            print(f"Pasted: {repr(event.text)}")
        else:
            print(f"Regular key: {ks}")


Focus Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Focus tracking reports when the terminal window gains or loses focus:

.. code-block:: python

    from blessed import Terminal
    from blessed.keyboard import FocusEvent

    term = Terminal()

    with term.dec_modes_enabled(term.DecPrivateMode.FOCUS_IN_OUT_EVENTS):
        print("Switch focus to/from terminal window...")
        while True:
            ks = term.inkey()

            if ks.event_mode == term.DecPrivateMode.FOCUS_IN_OUT_EVENTS:
                event = ks.mode_values()
                status = "gained" if event.gained else "lost"
                print(f"Focus {status}")
            elif ks == 'q':
                break


Focus Events
------------

As a bonus, blessed also supports focus tracking! Enable
:attr:`DecPrivateMode.FOCUS_IN_OUT_EVENTS` to receive events when the terminal
window gains or loses focus:

.. code-block:: python

    from blessed import Terminal

    term = Terminal()

    with term.cbreak(), term.dec_modes_enabled(term.DecPrivateMode.FOCUS_IN_OUT_EVENTS):
        print("Switch to another window and back...")

        while True:
            event = term.inkey()

            if event.mode == term.DecPrivateMode.FOCUS_IN_OUT_EVENTS:
                focus = event.mode_values()
                if focus.gained:
                    print("Window gained focus!")
                else:
                    print("Window lost focus!")
                break

This can be useful for pausing animations or updating status when the user
switches away from your application.
